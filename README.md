**GROW Sensor Locations Mapping**

This project visualizes the locations of GROW sensors across the UK by plotting them on a map using latitude and longitude data. The sensor locations are filtered to fit within the UK's geographical boundaries, and the data is cleaned to correct any column mismatches.

**Features**

**Data Cleaning:** Corrects any misnamed columns in the dataset (latitude and longitude swap).

**Data Filtering:** Filters sensor data to only include valid locations within the UKâ€™s bounding box.

**Visualization:** Plots the sensor data on a UK map using matplotlib for visualization.

**Output:** Saves the resulting map with sensor locations as a PNG image file.
